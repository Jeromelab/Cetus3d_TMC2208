# Cetus3d_TMC2208
This is TMC2208 stepstick drivers extension board for Cetus3d mk3 printer.
Original stepper drivers in Cetus3d printer are set for 32 microsteps, so I added Attiny85 to configure trinamic drivers for 32 microsteps. By default current is set by adjusting referense voltage with the potentiometer. It also can be set by Attiny's firmware (same current for all axis). My printer has stepper motors with 31 ohms coil resistance, so current has to be set low. Can't find any information about cetus motors. I think maximum current should be no more than 400mA. Reference voltage on my printer is set to: x 0.15v, y 0.1v, z 0.2v. I left extruder on original driver since it's not that loud anyway. Motor pins on stepsticks were soldered pointing up not down. After board was installed it's hard to put cover back on. I had to remove spacer on power switch to slide cover back in place. Modified spacer can be installed after cover. Also needs some insulation  between bottom of exension board and cover to prevent short circuit.
